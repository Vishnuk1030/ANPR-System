# AUTOMATED CAR NUMBER PLATE RECOGINITION SYSETM

Automated Car Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a technology that enables the
recognition of license plate numbers of vehicles. It uses image processing algorithms
and optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to identify and extract the license
plate number from an image captured by a camera. The extracted number is then
compared against a database of registered vehicle plates to identify the vehicle. In the
ANPR system, the first step is to capture an image of the license plate using a camera.
The captured image is then pre-processed to remove any noise and improve the
image quality. The next step is to locate the license plate in the image, which can be
done using techniques such as edge detection and contour detection. The characters
on the license plate are then segmented and isolated
